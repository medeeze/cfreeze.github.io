# [Project: Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk](https://github.com/medeeze/Kaggle_Home_Project)

Home Credit would like to provide customers with the ability to request loans despite 
having a lack of credit history. Without credit history, it is difficult to predict the likeliness 
of a given customer to pay off their debt which is a risk lenders usually avoid.

Creating a model that can accurately predict a customerâ€™s likeliness of credit default. Trained a model using historical customer data given by Home Credit. This will be a supervised classification model that determines the probability of the target variable: credit default. Through the combination of calculating the significance of one variable and the relationship between multiple variables, a test set can be created to provide a probability of the target variable happening.

## Main Segments of the Project
* Prepare and clean datasets to improve model performance
* Analyze the relationships between the variables of multiple datasets with the target variable: credit default
* Train and test multiple methods through random forest, naive bayes, and logistic regression

## Personal Contribution To The Final Output
* Random forest model
* Logistic base model
* Code organization and comments
* Model results summaries

## Challenges Encountered
* Strategizing how to combine multiple datasets to create the highest performing model
* Effectively data cleaning datasets used for modeling
* Finding a way to take multiple approaches to modeling that are not as familiar such as: naive bayes and random forest

## Solution and Value
Our analysis found that certain demographic variables provide strong signals of default risk. We recommend leveraging these features in the model, while taking care to follow fair lending practices and assess for bias. In addition, we suggest using demographic insights to support customer segmentation, targeted interventions, and ongoing model monitoring. Since we found that demographics can help us predict loan default, we have to be aware of not using this information to become bias or discriminate against certain groups of people.
